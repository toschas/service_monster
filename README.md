## Usage

### Configuration

Before you can make calls to ServiceMonster you must configure the library with a valid API Token. You can request
a token be generated by ServiceMonster. The API Token ties the API request to a particualr ServiceMonster company id.

There are two ways to configure the ServiceMonster gem. You can pass a hash of configuration options when you create
a client, or you can use a configure block.

```ruby
client = ServiceMonster.client({api_key: "YOUR_KEY_HERE"})
```

```ruby
ServiceMonster.configure do |config|
  config.api_key = "YOUR_KEY_HERE"
end

client = ServiceMonster.client
```

* **q:** Search term. Supply this parameter with a value to return results on which this search term matches at least one of the fields.

* **limit:** The number of records to return in the result. Defaults to 10.
* **page:** The page of data to return in the result. Defaults to the first page of data.

If you wish to filter a resource for a particular value in a field or set of dates use the following three parameters.
